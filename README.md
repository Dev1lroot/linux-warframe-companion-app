# Linux Warframe Companion App

A desktop companion app for Warframe, built with Vue 3 and Vite, designed for Linux users who don't want to install AlecaFrame through tons of crutches. **Currently, the app only displays fissure tables in the browser, without additional UI layers or features.** All other features listed below are planned for future development.

## Planned Features

- View current in-game events and alerts
- Track Nightwave challenges and progress
- Display world state (e.g., Cetus, Fortuna, Cambion Drift cycles)
- Search and view item information
- Notifications for important events
- Responsive UI for desktop environments
- In-game HUD overlay for opening relics and other features
